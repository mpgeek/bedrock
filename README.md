Bedrock
=======
A superawesome developer-centric base theme and subtheme starter kit for Drupal 7. The frontend framework is foundation 4, and much of the Drupal heavy lifting is inspired by AdaptiveTheme, without the cruft or UI-generated CSS. Point-n-click themers will not enjoy this theme unless the default skin is appealing.

## The Idea
The working model is that this theme is never used directly; rather a subtheme is spun up from the STARTERKIT. At a minimum the spun-up subtheme defines the layout (grid config) and skin; the markup would be provided by the templates in the base theme. The real goal here is to make deployments a snap wihout needing UI clicks to complete the process.
