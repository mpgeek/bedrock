=======
A superawesome developer-centric base theme and subtheme starter kit for Drupal 7. The frontend framework is foundation 4, and much of the Drupal heavy lifting is inspired by AdaptiveTheme.

# The Idea
The working model is that this theme is never used directly; rather a subtheme is spun up from the STARTERKIT. At a minimum the spun-up subtheme defines the layout (grid config) and skin; the markup would be provided by the templates in the base theme.
